*** Assignment 2 Apartment Booking System ***

This is a web based tourist apartment booking system. The foundation
for the application is an object oriented model of a (very simplified) booking system.
To be able to interact with the model we present a web GUI.
All web stuff is implemented. The task is to get the model to work.

Try to do as little coding as possible (use Java classes and methods in particular
the collections, List/ArrayList and String)
*
* This is higher level programming arrays should be avoided.
*

Development environment
----------------------
The application is divided over a few directories in src

    - abs: Class for the server and a class for some default test data.
    - abs/model: The OO model classes. ABS is the class representing the overall system.
    - abs/view: Helper classes to generate HTML-pages

Workflow
--------
It's possible to run the server. Run class ABSServer (not fully functional)

Then inspect everything.
- See //TODO comments for where to code
- Some classes (or parts of) are finished, see comments in code (= "Nothing to do here").

1.  Start with Period class. Implement method overlaps(). Run testPeriod() in
    ABSTest class util test passes.

2.  Continue with the operations for Persons, see testCRUDPerson in ABSTest.
    Add methods to ABS and uncomment in test util everything works.

3.  In the same manner work with Apartments, see testCRUDApartments.

4.  Implement the final test to get operation on Bookings to work, see testCRUDBookings!

5.  In ABSServer uncomment a method at the time, run server, visit page test
    operations. See comments in ASBServer.

6.  Optional: Modify Server parts so that there is a search form (for Persons, Apartments or Bookings).
